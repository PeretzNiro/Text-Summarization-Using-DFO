## Overview

This project leverages Dispersive Flies Optimization (DFO) to tackle the extractive text summarization problem. DFO is a population-based swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by the behavior of flies hovering over food sources. 

### How It Works

1. **Document Processing**: Each document is processed into sentences and various linguistic features are extracted.
2. **Optimization Problem**: Sentence selection is formulated as an optimization problem where:
   - Each fly in the swarm represents a candidate summary (a subset of sentences)
   - The fitness function balances relevance, coherence, and length constraints
   - The goal is to find the optimal subset of sentences that best represents the document

3. **Algorithm Variants**: Multiple DFO variants have been implemented to improve performance:
   - Elite strategies to preserve the best solutions
   - Local search mechanisms to refine promising solutions
   - Momentum-based updates to escape local optima
   
4. **Evaluation**: Summaries are evaluated using ROUGE metrics against reference summaries.

### Advantages

- **Efficient Exploration**: DFO effectively explores the vast space of possible sentence combinations
- **Parallelizable**: Naturally supports multi-threaded processing for batch summarization
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different document types and summarization requirements
- **No Training Required**: Unlike neural approaches, this method doesn't require supervised training

## Features

- Multiple DFO algorithm variants:
  - Base DFO
  - Elite DFO
  - Momentum DFO
  - Local Search DFO
  - Elite Local DFO
  - Elite Momentum DFO
  - Hybrid (Elite Local Momentum) DFO

- Text preprocessing and feature extraction:
  - Document text cleaning and normalization
  - Sentence segmentation using spaCy
  - Position and length features
  - TF-IDF vectorization
  - Linguistic features (noun phrases, verb phrases, proper nouns)
  - Semantic features:
    - Sentence embeddings
    - Cosine similarity between sentences
    - Document vector similarity
  - Feature normalization
  - Multi-threaded batch processing
  - Efficient dataset loading and caching

- Comprehensive evaluation:
  - ROUGE metrics (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-3, ROUGE-L)
  - Statistical analysis of results
  - Performance metrics tracking

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PeretzNiro/Text-Summarization-Using-DFO.git
cd Text-Summarization-Using-DFO
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Dataset

The system uses the CNN/DailyMail dataset for training and evaluation. The dataset will be automatically downloaded when you run the code for the first time.

Dataset details:
- Name: CNN/DailyMail
- Version: 3.0.0
- Size: ~11.5k articles for testing
- Source: https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail

## Usage

1. Basic usage:
```python
from src import TextSummarizer, SummarizerConfig

# Create summarizer with default configuration
summarizer = TextSummarizer()

# Generate summary for a document
summary, scores, history = summarizer.summarize_document(document)
```

2. Run with custom configuration:
```python
config = SummarizerConfig(
    algorithm='dfo_elite_local_momentum',
    batch_size=32,
    n_jobs=-1,
    cache_features=True
)
summarizer = TextSummarizer(config)
```

3. Run from command line:
```bash
python main.py --algorithm dfo --num_papers 20 --batch_size 10
```

## Configuration

### DFO Parameters
- population_size: 90

- target_length_ratio: 0.08 (summary length)

### Fitness Calculation Weights
